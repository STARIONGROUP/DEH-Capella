# DEH-Capella

The DEH Capella is a Java plugin Application that makes use of the [Comet SDKJ](https://github.com/RHEAGROUP/COMET-SDKJ-Community-Edition),
which is available on Maven Central. It allows users to interactively exchange data between models built with the [Capella](https://www.eclipse.org/capella/) software and a ECSS-E-TM-10-25A data source.

The DEH Capella adapter is supported by all Capella versions starting from Capella 5.0 including Capella 6.x.
